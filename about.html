        <p class="about  cell large-8">I was born and raised in Mexico&#59; I migrated to the United States when I was only 13 years old with my family, in 2007.
          It was really difficult for me to adopt to this country: new language, new culture, new food, the good thing about comming to this new eviroment is that I get to have new opportunities to become a better person with education
           and enthusiasm.<br>
           Having been able to go to school in this country, has been one of the most and valuables oportunities I have have.</p>


          <p class="about"> The years I have been in school I have seen that nothing is impossible and education is the perfect way to really change my life
          I believed that education is a way to get civilized and make our society better.<br>
          Throughout my life I have been involved in some sort of art activity, from music to nowadays on the multimedia industry.
        There has been many obstacles I have faced, they have not been easy to overcome but, i have been able to manage to get over them.
       </p>
       <p class="about">One of my main goals in life is to work for a company that allow me to be myself and at the same time help my compunity become a
       more united. I want to expand my ideas to places that have limited resoures but are willing to do their best to achieved the best of them as people.
     <br>
   In my whole life I have learned to do several activities. At the age of 14 I learned how to play guitar, of course I was not really into music but I wanted to do something that not every body does.
 As I was learning guitar I decided to move forward and learned how to play the bass guitar, which  by knowing a little bit of guitar was kind of easy.</p>
